# kidcat

It's like [pidcat](https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat/) but it's written in Kotlin (and it doesn't work very well).

# Development

You can either run the `Main.main` method directly in IntelliJ or run the following command from your commandline.

```shell
./gradlew run
```

or with arguments like so

```shell
./gradlew run --args="--current"
```
